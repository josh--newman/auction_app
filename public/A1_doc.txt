# Required features

    All required features were implemented as per the Assignment 1 specification document (http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/2503ICT/Assessment/assign1/)

# Additional features

    Pagination of item#index was implemented. This additional feature was not required in the Assignment 1 specification, however it was added because of it's positive impact on the usability of the application

# Usability testing

    Throughout the development of the application, each new feature implemented was tested throughly on several modern browsers including Firefox, Safari and Chrome.

    My fiance also participated in a usablity testing session where she was given certain tasks to complete in the application.

    Positive feedback:
      [+] Easy to understand user interface
      [+] Able to quickly add new items

    Negative feedback:
      [-] The about page was confusing, the two icons were expected to be links to the information they talk about (this was implemented due to feedback)
      [-] Help page was a little hard to read
