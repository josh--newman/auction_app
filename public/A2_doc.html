<h2>How to use the app</h2>

<h4>Navigation links:</h4>

<h5>[PUBLIC ACCESS]</h5>

<ul>
<li>/items - This will navigate to the index of items for sale. You can then use the search form to search by keyword, description and category</li>
<li>/items/{num} - This shows a detailed description of a particular item and allows a logged in user to bid on that item</li>
<li>/about - A brief description of the website and it's features</li>
<li>/signup - Allows a potential user to create an account</li>
<li>/signin - Existing users can sign in through this page</li>
</ul>

<h5>[SIGNED IN]</h5>

<ul>
<li>/users - Shows a list of all users signed up to the site and their gravatar (profile picture). You can then click on a user's name to view their profile</li>
<li>/categories  - This is only accessible by an admin. They can view, create, edit and delete categories that can be associated with items</li>
<li>/users/{num} - This corresponds to the user's profile page where they can perform various administrative tasks such as listing an item, editing account details, deleting items and viewing their bid history and won items </li>
</ul>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li>I assumed that bids cannot be deleted by any means other than the item they are attached to being deleted</li>
<li>Users cannot update or change their passwords, only their name and email address</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design decisions</h2>

<ul>
<li>A cancel button accompanies every form on creation or updating in case a user wishes to cancel their current action</li>
<li>Items on the index page the item summaries are quite large. This was to keep focus of the page on the items themselves and not any other aspect of the page</li>
<li>The navigation header was kept fixed to the top to allow quick access to links and account pages</li>
<li>Back buttons were removed due to redundancy and confusion</li>
<li>A two column layout for both the item details page and the user profile page was chosen due to the fact that those pages can be acted on by users, the same layout wasn't chosen for the item index page or any other pages that don't require user actions because they would have had empty space and thrown off the consistency of the pages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation techniques</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Image upload</p>

<ul><li>Implemented using 'Paperclip' and 'ImageMagick'</li>
<li>Requires that ImageMagick be installed on the server</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Authorisation</p>

<ul><li>The application uses many before_actions in controllers to limit users from making actions that they aren't authorised to do</li>
<li>In the views profiles admin panels are shown only if you are viewing your own profile. You can't see other user's admin panels</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Other</p>

<ul><li>If you are viewing your own profile it says "You are listing >", if you are viewing someone else's profile it says "#{user.first_name} is listing >"</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements implemented</h2>

<ul>
<li>All of the requirements from the Assignment 2 specifications was implemented except the following:
<ul><li>Responsive design, this was due to time contraints</li>
<li>Ajax updating, also due to time contraints</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Features working</h2>

<p>All features are working correctly and consistently</p>

<h2>Usability testing</h2>

<p>Throughout the development of the application, each new feature implemented was tested throughly on several modern browsers including Firefox, Safari and Chrome.</p>

<p>My fiance also participated in a usablity testing session where she was given certain tasks to complete in the application.</p>

<h4>Positive feedback:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Easy to navigate user interface</li>
<li>Beautiful graphics</li>
<li>Links and actions are simple to locate and are in a predictable location</li>
</ul>

<h4>Negative feedback:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Number field when listing an item is scrollable and causes inconsistent (but valid) input</li>
<li>Changing your profile image isn't easy to understand how to do</li>
</ul>
